# Milestone-4: Card game

## Learning Competencies
By the end of this milestone ensure that you
 - [ ] write tests for any program you are ever going to build
 - [ ] are able to create and use object prototypes in js
 - [ ] have understood how everything is an object in js & how powerful it is
 - [ ] have practiced refactoring methods for your code
 - [ ] able to appreciate the importance of thinking of time and planning of the project
 - [ ] learn and practice a few software design patterns like Don't-Repeat-Yourself etc

## Problem Statement
> Playing cards have always been fascinating for mathematicians and logicians. Right from the fact that the number of card shuffles possible are more than the atoms on earth (There are 80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (67 zeros) ways to arrange a deck of 52 cards) to the fact that you could beat some of the biggest casinos by using high school level math; a simple deck of playing cards have always intrigued, amused and sometimes bewildered us.

Pick one card game(Solitaire, Hearts, Rummy, Cheat, BlackJack, Mahjong etc) that you want to implement. It's fine if you want to implement more than one card game. Create the full featured game as a web application that runs on any modern browser and deploy it.

## Hints
- Explore various card games and understand the logic behind each
- Finalize a game which fascinates you the most
- Think of game logic and write down your algorithm for handling all the edge cases
- Break the overall project into features
- Take care of UX and UI: Build [wireframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe)
- You may deploy your product on the cloud using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Original [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) game was actually hosted on Github Pages.
